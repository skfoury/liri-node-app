I was able to get a program which does all of the functions intended but not exactly in the way intended. To get it closer , I would use the notepad approach to make it so that liri will respond to commands that way it will show the intended result rather than the clunky system of having all 3 commands and results at once that I created. To do this, separate files with the code required for the commands or have them as functions within a single code file. maybe a function running when process.argv is equal to a search term relevant to one of the results would be a good solution. I could also use inquirer to have the user select if they wanted to search spotify, bands in town, or omdb.
